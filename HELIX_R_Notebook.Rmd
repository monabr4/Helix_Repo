## PM606 Health Data Science Practicum: Final Report and Poster Project Instructions

The Master of Science in Public Health Data Science at USC has a summer practicum where students are tasked with preparing a report and presentation based on their analysis of external data and a set of interesting research questions. The HELIX study will provide the data for the practicum. These data will provide students with a unique learning experience where they must access a data source and deal with a study consisting of \~1000 participants and many variables. Students must apply analytic tools that they have learned through the core courses of the Data Science program including data wrangling, data visualization, regression analysis, and machine learning.

## HELIX Project Description:

```{r image-helix, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='', out.width='100%', out.width='100%'}
#knitr::include_graphics(paste0(work.dir, "/HELIX.png"))
```

Due to our ever-changing environment and habits, exposure to environmental contaminants is growing increasingly complex. The totality of environmental (non-genetic) exposures from conception until old age is defined as the ‘exposome’. The HELIX ‘early-life exposome’ approach involves combining all environmental hazards that mothers and children are exposed to, and linking this to the health, growth, and development of children.

Pregnancy and the early years of life are well recognized to be periods of high susceptibility to environmental damage with lifetime consequences. Characterization of the exposome in early life can provide very effective tools for disease prevention, given that interventions at that time can reshape biological programming and shift the body’s developmental track to the normal function. This makes early life an important starting point for development of the exposome. The results of the project will help us to better understand how various types of exposures combine to influence our risk of disease.

To achieve this, HELIX uses six existing, prospective birth cohort studies in Europe (BiB, EDEN, INMA, KANC, MoBa, Rhea). These cohorts have already collected large amounts of data as part of national and EU-funded projects. To supplement the already collected data, The HELIX project will develop a comprehensive set of high-tech tools, methods, and prospective data to measure and integrate the chemical, physical and molecular environment and link this to health of children. Smart phones are used to measure air pollution, UV radiation, physical activity, and noise exposure. The latest laboratory techniques are used to measure biological indicators of many chemical exposures including contaminants in food, consumer products and water. In all, HELIX has collected full exposome data from mothers and their children, the largest study to do this. HELIX used a multilevel study design with the entire study population totaling 31,472 mother–child pairs, recruited during pregnancy, in the six existing cohorts (first level); a subcohort of 1301 mother-child pairs where biomarkers, omics signatures and child health outcomes were measured at age 6-11 years (second level); and repeat-sampling panel studies with around 150 children and 150 pregnant women aimed at collecting personal exposure data (third level). For more details on the study design see Vrijheid, Slama, et al. EHP 2014. see <https://www.projecthelix.eu/index.php/es/data-inventory> for more information regarding the study.

For PM606 we will use subcohort of 1301 mother-child pairs to potentially examine multiple questions of interest related to environmental exposures, omic data and their impact on health.

### Expected Outcomes:

The final product from this project will be a report and poster describing the data analytic process and the findings from examining the impact of environmental exposures and omic data on an outcome or phenotype.

Specifically, in the HELIX project you will examine the impact of environmental exposures and/or omic features on a outcome/phenotype controlling for appropriate covariates and confounders.

Environmental exposures are classified into four different categories (you should choose multiple exposures to examine):

1)  Outdoor exposures
2)  Indoor air
3)  Lifestyle **
4)  Chemicals **

Outcomes/Phenotypes include (you should select one outcome to examine):

1)  Birthweight 
2)  Asthma
3)  Body mass index z-score
4)  Intelligence quotient
5)  Behavior
6)  Body mass index (cat) **

There are multiple covariates or potential confounders and specific variables should be chosen given the specific hypothesis for the select exposure and outcome.

In addition there are several omic data sets available for analysis including:\
1) Proteomics: <https://www.projecthelix.eu/images/HELIX_Proteome_DataSummary.pdf>\
2) Urine metabolomics: <https://www.projecthelix.eu/files/HELIX_urine_metabol_DataSummary.pdf>\
3) Serum metabolomics: <https://www.projecthelix.eu/images/HELIX_serum_metabol_DataSummary.pdf>\ **
4) Germline genetics: This is simulated data that is not real data but can be used to examine the impact of genetic data on the outcome.

### Analysis Objectives:

You should analyze the data with the following major steps in mind:

1)  To provide descriptive statistics of the data through summary statistics
2)  To provide descriptive statistics of the data through visualization techniques
3)  To fit exploratory linear (for continuous) and logistic (for binary) regression models to assess effects of risk factors on outcomes (i.e., FEV, asthma) on the entire data set and by important subgroups
4)  To develop the best fitting model, either through regression or machine learning techniques, that predicts the outcome of interest
5)  Perform sensitivity analysis for validation using training and test sets to determine model performance
6)  To summarize findings from the models using both tabular and graphical displays
7)  To provide interpretation for the main findings of the final models
8)  Prepare a report summarizing your goals, methods, and main findings
9)  Make a poster presentation during the last day of class
10) Methods will draw from Data Science courses on logistic regression and machine learning (including random forests, gradient boosting, clustering). The analyses will be conducted in R, and the analysis scripts and report should be published on their personal GitHub website.

### Components of an Effective Report for Scientific Communication:

1)  Title: A descriptive title that is informative and concise.

2)  Abstract: A brief summary of the main findings and conclusions.

3)  Introduction: A brief overview of the research question, the data, and the methods used.



Research Question:
How do prenatal dietary intake and concentrations of prenatal phthalate exposures influence body mass index (BMI)  for children 6-11 years old  while controlling for  child age at examinations and gestational age at birth, and can urine metabolomics data improve predictive models of BMI using statistical and machine learning tools?

Introduction:

The relationship between prenatal environmental exposures and childhood health outcomes is important, especially in understanding how prenatal factors influence long-term health in children. This data project aims to explore the influence of prenatal dietary intake and phthalate exposure concentrations on body mass index (BMI) in children aged 6 to 11 years. Phthalates, commonly found in plastics and personal care products, are known endocrine disruptors that may impact fetal development and childhood growth patterns (Valvi et al., 2020). Previous studies have shown that prenatal exposure to phthalates is associated with an increased risk of obesity and metabolic disorders in children (Luo et al., 2020). By controlling for key variables such as child age at examinations and gestational age at birth, this project seeks to examine the direct and interactive effects of these prenatal exposures on BMI.

Recent studies emphasize the important role of maternal diet during pregnancy, demonstrating that balanced maternal nutrition can mitigate the adverse effects of environmental exposures like phthalates on child BMI, suggesting that improved dietary practices during pregnancy can lead to better health outcomes for children (NCBI, 2024).


Phthalate exposure has been linked to various health issues, including obesity, type II diabetes, thyroid dysfunction, higher blood pressure, precocious puberty, and reproductive effects. It also impacts the respiratory system (allergy, asthma) and nervous system (delayed neurodevelopment, social impairment) (Serrano et al., 2021).

Furthermore, this project investigates whether urine metabolomics data can improve predictive models of BMI using statistical and machine learning approaches. Integrating metabolomics data helps to understand the biochemical pathways linking prenatal exposures (diet and phlates) to childhood health outcomes. This project aims to provide insights into the prevention and management of childhood obesity and related health conditions.
